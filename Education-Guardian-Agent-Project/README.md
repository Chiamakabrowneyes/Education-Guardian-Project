### Testing: 
Sample Prompts for Each Agent
1. **Goal Setting Agent**
   I'm from Nigeria and currently in my final year of secondary school. I have a 4.5 GPA on a 5.0 scale.
   I'm passionate about technology, especially artificial intelligence and software development.
   I'm looking for a school that offers strong CS programs, ideally with scholarship opportunities.
   Iâ€™d prefer schools in safe urban areas with international student support.

2. **University Matching Agent**
   Iâ€™m looking for universities in the U.S. that are strong in engineering and tech, especially AI.
   I'd like a school that values diversity, has an inclusive culture, and provides substantial financial aid.
   My GPA is 4.5/5.0, and Iâ€™d prefer somewhere in the East Coast or Midwest. I'm open to public or private institutions.

3. **Test Prep Agent**
   Iâ€™m interested in going to Stanford or Duke, or any other great institution in the United States.
   Iâ€™m a native English speaker but will need to take the SAT. TOEFL isnâ€™t required for my country of origin.
   I would like a personalized study plan. Iâ€™m planning to take the SAT at the end of the year.
   I can commit about 15 hours per week to practice and would like to include biweekly mock tests in my schedule.
   My target score is 1450+.

4. **Essay Mentor Agent**
   Iâ€™m focusing on the Common App prompt about overcoming a challenge and how it shaped me.
   A few schools also ask about community impact and academic interests. Iâ€™m considering writing about building a safety app for Nigeria,
   or teaching myself to code during COVID to support my sisterâ€™s restaurant. I want to emphasize resilience and initiative,
   and how I used technology to make a real-world impact.

5. **Recommendation Letter Agent**
   I'm applying to the University of California (UC) schools, Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
   I plan to ask my chemistry and math teachers for recommendation letters since Iâ€™ve done really well in their classes
   and theyâ€™ve seen my growth over time. Iâ€™d like tips on how to approach them and what makes a strong recommendation letter.

6. **Extracurricular Agent**
   I enjoy coding, playing chess, and volunteering in my community. I once led a tutoring program for younger students.
   Iâ€™m also passionate about using tech for social impact. Iâ€™d love suggestions on how to make my extracurriculars stand out,
   especially for computer science programs.
